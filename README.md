I'm a code hobbyist living in Canada and teaching myself languages in my free time.

A collection of small projects that I've coded, generally single file.

Projects that are in this repo:

  - MWS file changer.py:            Changes file names of MWSHQ files to ones compatible with Magic Album and adds them to archive.
  - ddate.py:                       Prints out the current date from the Discordian calendar and any holydays/whollydays
  - churn_form_anon.html:           Generate all information for churn form ticket for Company.  HTML/CSS3/JavaScript
  - pword_search.py:                Searches a user-generated list of sites they have passwords from for sites in the MOABreaches.
  - Scrython Image Downloader.py:   Download images from Scryfall for a specific Magic set, setting the image file names to work with Magic Album
