I'm a code hobbyist living in Canada and teaching myself languages in my free time.

A collection of small projects that I've coded, generally single file.

Projects that are in this repo:
  MWS file changer.py                 Changes file names of MWSHQ files to ones compatible with Magic Album and adds them to archive.
  ddate.py                            Prints out the current date from the Discordian calendar and any holydays/whollydays
